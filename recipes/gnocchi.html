      <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15
          minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until
          gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.
