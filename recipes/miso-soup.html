      <h2>What is Miso Soup?</h2>
      <p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup that starts with a dashi stock and is flavored with miso paste. Dashi
        is an umami-rich stock made from dried seaweed and dried fish. Miso paste, meanwhile, is a paste made from
        soybeans, salt, and koji rice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brothy soup usually contains tofu and green onions. It can also feature seaweed, mushrooms, daikon, and
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miso soup is traditionally served with rice.
